# Doc-Bias KG

A hybrid AI system capable of identifying bias patterns in datasets used by predictive AI models. The proposed system captures knowledge about dataset characteristics and represents it as factual statements in a knowledge graph.

The proposed hybrid AI system is used to trace the PSL implementation of the AI model for fake news detection (https://doi.org/10.1145/3340531.3412066). 

This repository contains:
Doc-BiasKG: schema, mapping rules, resulting experiments. 
DataSources: The data files generated to trace the fake news model and dataset defined in: https://github.com/linqs/chowdhury-cikm20.
sparql_queries: A connection to the SPARQL endpoint to run queries over the KG.
